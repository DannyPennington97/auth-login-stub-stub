# auth-login-stub-stub
I'm making a stub for auth login stub that can pre-fill the required fields the service you wish to access. 

Undecided exactly what to use but probably define json with the fields/enrolements that can be stored in the /config folder. That way people can expand on it by adding their own configs etc.
